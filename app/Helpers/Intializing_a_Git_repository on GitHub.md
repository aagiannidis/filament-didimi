When using **Approach A** (removing `.git` and starting fresh), ideally the remote repository should be **completely empty** (no initial commit, no README, etc.). If you accidentally created the remote with a README or any commit, Git will warn you that your local branch is behind the remote branch and reject the push.

Here are a few ways to resolve this, depending on what you want:

---

## 1. **Use a Truly Empty Remote Repository**

1. On GitHub, when creating your new repository, **uncheck** “Add a README,” “Add .gitignore,” or any other options. The repository should have **0 commits**.
2. On your local machine, remove your `.git` folder and reinitialize:
    ```bash
    rm -rf .git
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin <YOUR_NEW_EMPTY_REPO_URL>
    git push -u origin main
    ```
3. Now the push should succeed without any errors because there are no remote commits to conflict with.

---

## 2. **Force Push to Overwrite the Remote**

If you **must** push to a remote that already has some initial commit(s) and you don’t care about keeping those remote commits, you can **force push**. But **be cautious**: force pushing will overwrite whatever is in the remote with your local commits.

1. Remove your `.git` folder and reinitialize (Approach A):
    ```bash
    rm -rf .git
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin <YOUR_REPO_URL>
    ```
2. **Force push** to overwrite the remote:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main --force
    ```
3. This tells Git to disregard the remote’s history and replace it with your local history.

> **Warning**: This action is destructive for any existing remote commits.

---

## 3. **Fetch & Merge or Rebase (to Preserve Remote Changes)**

If there **are** commits in the remote that you want to keep, you’d have to do something other than a full re-initialization. Typically, you’d:

1. **Clone** (or use the existing clone).
2. **Fetch** and **merge** or **rebase** the remote commits into your local branch.
3. Commit the changes.
4. Then push normally.

Since you specifically mentioned you **do not want to fetch** (which suggests you don’t want the remote commits at all), you’d fall back to option #1 (empty repo) or #2 (force push).

---

## **Key Takeaways**

-   If you want a fresh start **without any remote commits**, make sure the remote is truly empty (no initial commit).
-   If there is an unwanted initial commit on the remote, either delete that repository and create a new empty one or force-push to overwrite it.
-   Force pushing is destructive, so use it only if you’re certain you don’t need the remote’s existing history.
